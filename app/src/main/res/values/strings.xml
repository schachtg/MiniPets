        "To see how your pet is doing, you can pet them by tapping on them in the home screen. "
        "Your pet will then display a happy, average, or sad emote, depending on how it's feeling. "
        "If your pet is feeling sad, you can feed them to make them happier, and if you leave them. "
        "alone for awhile, they will get sadder. You can buy cheap food for your pet which they wont "
        "like all that much, or you can buy expensive food which will make them much happier.\n\n"

        "You can tap the inventory drop down in the top left of the home screen to open the inventory. "
        "From there, each item will display an action beside the item name. If the item says Feed before "

        "buy several items. The cost of each item will be displayed besides the item's name, and the total "
        "number of tokens you have will be listed near the top of the screen. Once you tap an item, it will "
        "be added to your inventory.\n\n"

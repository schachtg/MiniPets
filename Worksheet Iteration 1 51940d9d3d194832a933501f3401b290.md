# Worksheet Iteration 1

***Adding a feature***:

When trying to add petting your pet, the original idea was to have the user rub their finger on the screen rather than just tapping. Shortly after trying to implement this, the decision to just make the user tap the pet was made. This was done because it felt natural and was much easier to implement. The next step was to display a reaction image. This was done by overlaying a picture over the pet, and making that picture visible when the pet reacted. The project was then pushed to the repository, where the feature was unedited until having the reaction disappear was added.

***Exceptional code:***

- This was a test for "buying an item" in the shop section. What was tested was if the correct item was being purchased (if you tap on fish, check if fish is actually purchased), along with after buying several items, is the amount of bought items equal. We tested to throw this exception because it is important to have the correct values of items within our game. For future iterations, feeding your pet is very important. If a user is being told they are buying food for their pet, but are actually buying toys, that would be a game breaking bug.

For context, the top "second commit" is from our feature branch called "PetDatabase", and the Merge branch 'ReactionTimers' is a merge with the main/master branch when ReactionTimers was complete. 

***SOLID violation:***

 Above is the link to the issue created. 

***Agile Planning:***

Originally, we were wanting to add the "feed my pet" feature into iteration 1. We had to push this back because of time reasons. Some features taking longer than expected and having some growing pains while learning Android Studio are the main culprits for where we lost time.   

An hour before the due date, we have came across some issues with the fetch feature. We are sadly forced to push this to iteration 2, since at the current state it isn't much of a fetch game. The feature is very close to completion, so it shouldn't be too big of a burden to add onto the next

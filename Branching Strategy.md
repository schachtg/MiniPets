### BRANCHING STRATEGY

Our branching strategy is fairly simple. The idea of it is to keep the master/main branch as clean and bug free as possible. Every time one of us wants to work on a new feature for the project, we create a new branch that is based off of the master/main branch. This way, if something starts going wrong with the application, we know where the issue is. The only time one of us will merge our "feature branch" back to master/main is when the feature is completely finished and completely tested.

The image "branching strategy.jpg" is located within our master/main branch. This image is a basic flowchart that visualizes our branching strategy.
